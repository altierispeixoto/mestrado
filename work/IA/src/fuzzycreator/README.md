fuzzycreator
===========

What is it?
-----------
fuzzycreator is a toolkit for automatic generation and analysis of fuzzy sets
from data. It facilitates the creation of both conventional and
non-conventional (non-normal and non-convex) type-1, interval type-2 and
general type-2 (zSlices-based) fuzzy sets from data. These FSs may then
be analysed and compared through a series of tools and measures (included
in the toolkit), such as evaluating their similarity and distance.
For a list of available measures, please refer to docs/measures.pdf.
